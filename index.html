					About Kathan Cheema
				</div>

				<div style="text-transform: initial; font-size: large">
					<p>Hello there! I am a third year (penultimate) student, studying Computer Science (Honours) at the University of St Andrews.
						I have an interest in game development, artificial intelligence, human computer interfaces, web development, and networking.
					</p>
					<p>
						My hobbies are game development, artificial intelligence, human computer interfaces, web development, and networking and
						I try to make time to do some game development, artificial intelligence, human computer interfaces, web development, and networking
						in my spare time.
					</p>

					<p>
						If by any chance you are looking for an enthusiastic and hard working developer in perhaps one of these areas:
						game development, artificial intelligence, human computer interfaces, web development, and networking, then
						I would encourage you to look at my cv or past projects.
					</p>

					<h4>Space Quest</h4>
					<p>
						This is a revolutionary game I developed for iOS and macOS which uses a novel input method
						to guide your player through the dangers of space.
					</p>

					<p>Available for free on the (external links) Mac App Store or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/space-quest/id1330638718?mt=8">iOS App Store</a>.</p>


					<h4>Quick Argument Parser</h4>
					<p>
						This is a java library designed to enhance developer productivity by quickly mapping arguments to method calls without recompiling.
					</p>
					<p>The project is on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cheemcheem">here</a>.</p>
